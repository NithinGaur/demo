control statements enable us to specify the order in which the various statements in a program are to  be executed.
three types control statements 
=> Selection statements (if,if..else,if..elif..else)
=> Iterative statements ( while , for)
=> Transfer statements (break, continue, pass, return)

The if statement:  The if statement is a selection control statement. It selects the appropriate set of instructions to execute based on the value of  a given boolean expression.
In Python-Speak a block of code that is sequence of one or more statements is called a suite.

_____________________________________________________
if boolean_expression:      #if header 
    if_suite
statement-x  #immediate next statement after the if structure 
 _____________________________________________________
  
if  the boolean_expression evaluates to true , the if_suite gets executed and then the next statement after the simple if structure i.e statement-x gets executed .
if the boolean_expression evalutes to false , the if_suite is skipped off and the control goes to the next statement after the simple if structure. 

#program to calcuate the discount
#A discount of 16% is offered to the customers on purchases >=Rs 10,000
discount,discount_amount=0.0 , 0.0
purchases=float(input('Enter the value of purchases :Rs '))
if purchases >= 10000: #if header 
    discount=16
    discount_amount= purchases*discount/100
total_bill=purchases - discount_amount
print('TotalBill Rs:%.2f'%(total_bill))

Test Cases:

Test Case 1: Enter the value of purchases :Rs 12500
             TotalBill Rs:10500.00

Test Case 2: Enter the value of purchases :Rs 8000
                       TotalBill Rs:8000.00
